    Makefile           A simple makefile that delegates all requests to
                       the outer directory's makefile.
                        
    Main.java          Entry point to program. 

    UnitTest.java      Main unit-test file, which calls any others.

    Color.java          Defines symbolic names for the colors of squares
                        and players.

    Board.java          The superclass of playing boards.

    ConstantBoard.java  A type of Board that delegates operations to another
                        Board and does not allow operations that modify a
                        Board.

    MutableBoard.java   A type of Board whose contents can be changed.

    Game.java           Abstracts the complete state of a game and
                        solicits moves from Players.

                        a depth of 4 to make moves. Depth can be altered, although
                        computation time will increase. 

    Defaults.java       Gathering place for default parameters.

    GameException.java  Used for internal signalling of user errors,

    Usage.txt           A resource containing a Usage message.

    BoardTest.java      Some unit tests on Boards.

    GameTest.java       Some unit tests for the game state.

       test1.in         Simple test, showing the format of test files.
                        REMINDER: This is a sample only.  It DOESN'T
